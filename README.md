# Azure Automation Starter
This small demo repository shows how to Start an azure runbook programmatically. While the example scenario contacts and rates on provisioning a Microsoft Team the code can be re-used for any scenario. 
It's kept quite simple

## Summary

The repository consists of three parts: 
AzureAutomationStarter realizes The start of a runbook using the .Net SDK
AzureAutomationStarterRest realizes The start of a runbook using the rest api following the same scenario
